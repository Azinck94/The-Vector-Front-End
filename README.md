I used bootstrap, css, html, ember, and javascript to complete to client side of this application.

I wanted to create an application that allowed users to store and edit data about their customers in an easy to use interface. I implemented my past experience from previous solo and group projects in order to produce what I feel has been my smoothest, and most task oriented work flow process to date. I set daily deliverables and always kept the scope of things in focus, managing to cross off my to do list in an extremely methodical yet effective approach. I hit structural and relational requirements early on which was a blessing that allowed me to work towards finishing up new features, and I will roll out the new ability to schedule meetings with customers within the next day or two.  

I had major issues with my deployment but managed to find a workaround by cloning from ember auth template's config/environment.js file and restarting the process from there.
